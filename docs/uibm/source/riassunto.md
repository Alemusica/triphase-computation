**Title (EN):** Method and System for Extracting and Utilizing Computational Phase-Bits (Phits) from Asynchronous Clock Domain Relationships in Digital Processors

A method and system for extracting and utilizing computational phase-bits ("phits") from the phase relationships between asynchronous clock domains in digital processors. The invention treats clock phase information — currently discarded as noise in conventional processor design — as an exploitable computational resource. A phit is defined as the unit of information derived from the phase relationship between two asynchronous clocks. The invention provides methods for software-based phit extraction achieving 1.96 phits per single read and 4.06 phits per compound read on commodity hardware (Apple M1 Max), without requiring hardware modification. Three applications are demonstrated: (1) a pseudo-random number generator passing four NIST SP 800-22-inspired statistical tests at 181 Mbit/s throughput; (2) lock-free task routing at 28 million routes per second with zero shared state and zero lock contention; and (3) phase-gated encryption where the key exists only as a temporal relationship between clock frequencies. Three computational paradigms are defined for utilizing phits: phase-gated computation, phase-weighted computation, and phase-encoded computation. A hardware ISA extension (RDPHI) is proposed for direct phase readout, projected to achieve 100-300x throughput improvement over the software method. A portable header-only C library (libphit.h) implements the methods across macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD.

INDEPENDENT CLAIMS / RIVENDICAZIONI INDIPENDENTI

Claim 1. A method for extracting information from the phase relationship between asynchronous clock domains in a digital processor, comprising:
(a) executing a calibrated computational workload on the processor, wherein the workload execution time varies with the phase relationship between the processor's execution clock and a system timer clock;
(b) reading a system timer value after completion of the workload;
(c) combining the least-significant bits of the timer value, which are provably uniform due to the asynchronous relationship between clock domains, with a representation of the workload execution result to produce a phase-dependent value;
(d) applying a hash function to the phase-dependent value to produce a phit (phase-bit) sample;
(e) optionally repeating steps (a) through (d) with varied workload seeds and accumulating the results using rotation and exclusive-or operations to produce a compound phit sample with higher information content than a single sample.

Claim 2. A method for lock-free task routing in a multi-processor system, comprising:
(a) extracting a phit sample according to the method of Claim 1;
(b) computing a worker identifier as the phit sample modulo the number of available workers;
(c) routing the task to the identified worker;
wherein no mutex, atomic counter, or shared memory is accessed during the routing operation, and the uniform distribution of phase samples ensures statistically uniform task distribution across workers.

Claim 3. A processor instruction (RDPHI) for reading the instantaneous phase relationship between two specified asynchronous clock domains, comprising:
(a) a phase comparator circuit implemented as a flip-flop that samples the counter of one clock domain on the rising edge of another clock domain;
(b) storing the sampled phase value in a general-purpose register;
(c) wherein the phase value is available for general-purpose computation including arithmetic weighting, conditional gating, and state encoding, and is not limited to entropy extraction or random number generation.

Claim 4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the compound sampling uses N=2 sequential reads as the optimal trade-off between phit yield and throughput, producing approximately 4.06 phits per compound sample compared to 1.96 phits per single sample.

Claim 5. The method of Claim 1, wherein the uniformity of the timer's least-significant bits is validated by a Chi-squared test yielding a value below the critical threshold for the number of bins, confirming the asynchronous relationship between clock domains.

Claim 6. The method of Claim 1, further comprising accumulating phit samples into an entropy pool of N lanes of M bits each, using multiplicative hashing with golden ratio constants, SplitMix64 mixing, and cross-lane rotation, and extracting random values by combining all lanes with rotated exclusive-or and mutating the pool state after extraction for forward security.

Claim 7. The method of Claim 1, further comprising deriving a cryptographic keystream from the phase vector Phi(t) = (f_1*t mod 1, f_2*t mod 1, ..., f_K*t mod 1) at a specific time t, where f_1, f_2, ..., f_K are the frequencies of K asynchronous clock domains, and encrypting a plaintext message by exclusive-or with the keystream, wherein decryption requires knowledge of both the exact clock frequencies and the exact time of encryption.

Claim 8. The method of Claim 7, further comprising phase-locked access windows wherein decryption is only possible when the relative phase between a specified pair of clock domains falls within a predetermined range.

Claim 9. The instruction of Claim 3, further comprising companion instructions PHIGATE and PHIWEIGHT that respectively gate execution on a phase condition and return phase as a fixed-point arithmetic weight, enabling three computational paradigms: phase-gated computation, phase-weighted computation, and phase-encoded computation.

Claim 10. A portable software library implementing the methods of Claims 1, 2, 6, and 7 as a header-only C library with platform-specific timer backends for ARM, x86, and RISC-V architectures, providing phit extraction, compound sampling, entropy pool management, PRNG, lock-free routing, and self-test functionality without requiring hardware modification.
